# Hi, I'm ObsidianPresidium 👋
I'm an aspiring developer from Denmark 🇩🇰 currently studying at AspIT. I'm passionate about all things software and open-source. I enjoy writing scripts and software from the ground up, even though I know some things about frameworks and toolchains.
My favorite technologies to work with are GNU/Linux 🐧 (including shell scripts), Python 🐍, Svelte/SvelteKit 🧰 and other web frameworks 🌐. I'm fluent in both English and Danish, and I'm learning other Scandinavian languages.

### Some projects I'm currently working on are:

- [**SkejsChat**](https://github.com/SnoSoft/SkejsChat), a simple chat application built with .NET and SvelteKit
- [**minecraft-server-installer**](https://github.com/ObsidianPresidium/minecraft-server-installer), a Python script to quickly set up (and automatically update) a Minecraft server of various flavors
- [**info-screen-v2**](https://github.com/ObsidianPresidium/info-screen-v2), an updated version of my info-screen project made with a different toolchain.

### Some projects I've finished are:

- [**info-screen**](https://github.com/ObsidianPresidium/info-screen), an app for Raspberry Pi that displays information like what's currently playing on your Spotify account, and weather forecasts.
- [**dmi (lightning strikes app)**](https://github.com/ObsidianPresidium/aspit-s/tree/master/dmi), a graphical Python app that fetches recorded lightning strikes from the Danish Meteorological Institute's API and displays them on a map.

# Hi, I'm Emil 👋
I'm an aspiring developer from Denmark 🇩🇰 currently working as an intern at [CargoFlux](https://cargoflux.com) where I work with Ruby on Rails. I'm passionate about all things software and open-source. I enjoy learning about the intricacies of software, and inventive/optimized solutions.

I was a student at AspIT Copenhagen for 2 years, here I studied - and fell in love with - web development, and to a lesser extent Python and .NET.

My favorite technologies to work with are GNU/Linux 🐧 (including shell scripts), Svelte/SvelteKit 🧰, Python 🐍, and other web frameworks 🌐, though I am eager to learn other technologies as well. I'm fluent in both English and Danish, and I'm learning other Scandinavian languages.

### Some projects I'm currently working on are:

- [**ai-spoons**](https://github.com/ObsidianPresidium/ai-spoons), an AI-powered web app to help with scheduling and prioritization in daily life
- [**SkejsChat**](https://github.com/SnoSoft/SkejsChat), a simple chat application built with .NET and SvelteKit
- [**info-screen-v2**](https://github.com/ObsidianPresidium/info-screen-v2), an updated version of my info-screen project made with a different toolchain.

### Some projects I've finished are:

- [**info-screen**](https://github.com/ObsidianPresidium/info-screen), an app for Raspberry Pi that displays information like what's currently playing on your Spotify account, and weather forecasts.
- [**dmi (lightning strikes app)**](https://github.com/ObsidianPresidium/aspit-s/tree/master/dmi), a graphical Python app that fetches recorded lightning strikes from the Danish Meteorological Institute's API and displays them on a map.

### Some fun facts about me

- I was very active in Coding Pirates - which is a Danish youth club for coding - when I was little, here is where I learned that software was my passion. My best memory from there is working on an RPG with one of my friends there, written in Batch - yes, a DOS batch script.
- My first phone was a Sony Ericsson P990! It could do anything you wanted, though I mostly used its proprietary memory card for Java games and 3GP videos.
- I have played semi-professional Counter-Strike since 2021, mostly in the Danish Esport League. Currently playing for a team started by some friends and I.
- My daily driver is a modern Thinkpad running Fedora Linux with GNOME, which provides the perfect computing experience. At least until you want to try something new!
